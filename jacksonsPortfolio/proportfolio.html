            Frogge: This was a project I worked on for my second Hackathon sponsered by MLH.
            It won 3rd place in the category of strength and innovation. I helped coordinate team
            efforts, and designing the program.

            Semantic_BookOfMormon: This was a personal project, where I would take the Book of Mormon
            and run it through an embedding ai model. This would then allow me to search for verses based
            off of the "gist" of a verse. Imagine being able to look for something in text without knowing
            any of the words in the verse. That's my goal with this program.

            Ligtnin_tapanin_game: This was my first ever Hackathon, where my team made a website with an embedded Godot
            game that would teach you morse code. I learned Godot script and my task was to make the actual morse code
            code in 24 hours. The website doesn't work, but the game sure does!
