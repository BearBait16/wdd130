        <p id="hero-wia-text">Getting things to work is some of my favorite things! I also love working with good people. I've had some
        awesome mentors and co-workers that have helped me get to where I am today. Here is my resume!
        
        Outside of work, you'll find me playing games with the people I love! Whether it's exploring a fantasy world
        in Baldur's Gate 3, or fighting my friends in a friendly game of Root, I'll be enjoying the time with the people
        I'm with. As well, whenever I can, I perform! Right now I'm in the BYU-Idaho Improv group Comic Frenzy.</p>
