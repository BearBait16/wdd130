            Welcome to my website! I'm so glad you're here!
            The purpose of this website is to show off what I can do, and the experience I have. 
            My name is Jackson Aden, I'm a software engineering major at BYU-Idaho, and I love making stuff!

            Getting things to work is some of my favorite things! I also love working with good people. I've had some 
            awesome mentors and co-workers that have helped me get to where I am today. Here is my resume!

            Outside of work, you'll find me playing games with the people I love! Whether it's exploring a fantasy world 
            in Baldur's Gate 3, or fighting my friends in a friendly game of Root, I'll be enjoying the time with the people
            I'm with. As well, whenever I can, I perform! Right now I'm in the BYU-Idaho Improv group Comic Frenzy.

        <h3>Proffesional Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to my protfolio! This is a list of projects I have worked on in class, and outside of class.
            First, my out of class projects!

            Frogge: This was a project I worked on for my second Hackathon sponsered by MLH.
            It won 3rd place in the category of strength and innovation. I helped coordinate team 
            efforts, and designing the program. https://github.com/BearBait16/Frogge

            Frog Image: Frogge

            Semantic_BookOfMormon: This was a personal project, where I would take the Book of Mormon
            and run it through an embedding ai model. This would then allow me to search for verses based
            off of the "gist" of a verse. Imagine being able to look for something in text without knowing
            any of the words in the verse. That's my goal with this program. https://github.com/BearBait16/Semantic_BookOfMormon

            Ligtnin_tapanin_game: This was my first ever Hackathon, where my team made a website with an embedded Godot 
            game that would teach you morse code. I learned Godot script and my task was to make the actual morse code 
            code in 24 hours. The website doesn't work, but the game sure does! https://github.com/BearBait16/Lightnin_tapanin_game

        <h3>Theater Experience</h3>
        <p>
            This is my theater resume:

            Here are some notable mentions
            
            Most Recent Experience: BYU-Idaho's Comic Frenzy
            I've gotten to be a part of this awesome improv troupe for this 
            last semester, and it's been a blast! Learning to quickly react on my
            feet is an incredibly useful skill, both on and off the stage. I've also 
            come close to the other members on the team, they're all good friends.

            A voice acting role on the upcoming Anomaly series:
            I came across the audition through an on campus advertisement, and got a role
            as a hero twoards the end of the episode. I had to sign an nda, and when the episode
            is posted, it will be linked here.
